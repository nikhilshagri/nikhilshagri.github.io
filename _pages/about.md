Hi! I'm a fourth year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mahdi Cheraghchi](https://mahdi.ch/). I am mostly interested in topics in theoretical computer science. Specifically, I'm interested in Computational Complexity, Coding Theory, and the analysis of Boolean Functions.

Previously, I completed a masters at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/), and I completed my undergrad at the [LNM Institute of Information Technology](https://www.lnmiit.ac.in/).

Prior to working in theoretical computer science, I was really into working with memory safe languages, such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and even contributed to [Servo](https://servo.org/), an experimental web engine written using Rust.
