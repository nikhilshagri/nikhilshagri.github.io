**Moser's Entropy compression argument:** Terry Tao has a really good [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/mosers-entropy-compression-argument/) explaining Moser's constructive algorithm for the Lovasz Local Lemma.

**Existence of a prime between n, 2n:** Also known as the [Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate), this fact is often invoked when we want to work with finite fields which are just slightly larger than *n*. Erdös gave an [elementary proof](https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/pdf/bertrand.pdf) for this in 1932.

**Ronen's talk on Yuansi Chen's surprising breakthrough:** In this [video](https://youtu.be/F8vJzmMNGKs), Ronen Eldan gives a great overview of the history behind the KLS conjecture.

**The Biggest Number that there is:** Scott's classic [blog post](https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html), on writing down the biggest number possible on a piece of card, and how computability theory provides an interesting answer.

**Gaps between primes:** Another classic, this one's a [video](https://youtu.be/pp06oGD4m00) by Terry Tao, on the history to properly understand gaps (both small and large) in the set of primes.

**Natural Proofs Barrier:** Check out Gowers' [post](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/how-not-to-prove-that-p-is-not-equal-to-np/) for an excellent informal introduction to the natural proofs barrier.

**Reflections on Trusting Trust:** Ken Thompson's Turing award acceptance [speech](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf), where he talks about how it is possible to produce bugged compiler binaries (which pass all source code verification checks) that deliberately 'self-perputuate' the bugs within them.

**Intro to HDXs:**  Ryan O'Donnell's [video](https://youtu.be/DYmM3xJOS-g) gives a nice introduction to High Dimensional Expanders.

**On the Nature of Mathematical Proofs:** Andrew Granville in this [paper](https://mxphi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Granville.pdf) goes in to what is accepted to be the definition of a mathematical proof and how it has evolved over the centuries.

**Michel Talagrand's (short) Autobiography:** This [biography](https://michel.talagrand.net/BioAbel.pdf) (just over 20 pages) contains lots of entertaining anecdotes and also a few bits of useful advice for research in math.
